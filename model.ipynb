      "🧠 Predicted Answer: Fine-tuning in Generative AI is an approach that introduces minimal task-specific parameters and is trained on downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pre-trained parameters.\n",
      "✅ Reference Answer: Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained generative model and adapting it to a specific domain or task by training it on a smaller, specialized dataset.\n",
